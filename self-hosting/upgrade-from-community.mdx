<Warning> 
 Follow the instructions below first all the way to the end of the section `Restoring your data to your One instance`.

We strongly recommend you install on a fresh machine, not the one running Plane Community.
</Warning>

### Back up data
`setup.sh` in the Community Edition now comes with an option to back up your data.

1. Use  `./setup.sh` to open the operator menu and select `7` to backup your Plane data.
2. When done, your data will be backed up to the folder shown on the screen.
e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`
3. This folder will contain 3 `tar.gz` files.
    - `pgdata.tar.gz`
    - `redisdata.tar.gz`
    - `uploads.tar.gz`
4. Copy all the 3 files from the server running the Community Edition to any folder on the server running Plane One on any folder of your choice._createMdxContent

e.g., `~/ce-backup`

### Restore data to new instance
1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the folder with the back-up files.
    ```
    cd ~/ce-backup
    ```
2. Copy and paste the script below on Terminal and hit Enter.
    ```
    
    TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
    sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR
    for FILE in *.tar.gz; do
        if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
            tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
        else
            echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
            exit 1
        fi
    done

    mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
    mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
    mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
    mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
    ```
3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to /opt/plane/data.
4. Follow the instructions for new installations below.

## Install Plane

The Enterprise edition comes with a **free plan** and the flexibility to upgrade to a paid plan at any point.

### Prerequisites

      - A virtual or on-prem machine with atleast 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM
      - `x64` AKA `AMD 64` or `AArch 64` AKA `ARM 64` CPUs
      - Supported operating systems:
         - Ubuntu
         - Debian
         - CentOS
         - Amazon Linux 2 or Linux 2023

### Method

1. `ssh` into your machine as the root user (or user with sudo access) per the norms of your hosting provider.
2. Run the command below:  
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/ | sh -
    ```
3. Follow the instructions on the terminal. Hit `Enter` or `Return` to continue.
4. Enter the domain name where you will access the Plane app in the format `domain.tld` or `subdomain.domain.tld`. If you are using a paid plan, the domain linked to the license canâ€™t be changed later.

         - **Express**: Plane installs with the default configurations.
         - **Advanced**: You can customize the database, Redis, storage  and other settings.
6. The installation will take a few minutes to complete and you will see the message **Plane has successfully installed**. You can access the Plane application on the domain you provided during the installation. 
7. If you want to activate the license for a paid plan, see [Activate License](/self-hosting/activate-license).
