Starting v1.3.0, your license will need to be activated on an installed instance of our Enterprise Edition. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.

To activate the license of a paid plan on the Enterprise edition, follow the steps below:

      1. Login to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so).
      3. Go to [Manage licenses](https://prime.plane.so/licenses). Copy the value of the **License key** for the license you want to activate.

        If you don't have a license, you can buy one from the portal. You will see the selection screen as soon as you are in.
        </Note>
      5. On the Plane app, click the âŒ„ icon next to your workspace name on the sidebar and select **Workspace Settings**.
