## Self-hosted only
   <Note>
   Starting v1.3.0, your license will need to be activated on a self-hosted instance of our Enterprise Edition. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.
   </Note>
   
   Steps 1 to 5 above are exactly the same when upgrading to a paid plan on your self-hosted instance. To activate the license on your workspace, follow the steps below:

   1. After processing the payment, you will be redirected to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses), where you can access all the licenses you have purchased.

      <Note>
      If you want to purchase more licenses for your other workspaces, you can directly do that in the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses/plans) instead of the **Billing and plans** screen. Click the **Get more licenses** button as shown in the image above to buy more licenses.
      </Note>
   2. Copy the **License key** for the license you want to activate. 
   3. Go back to the **Billing and plans** screen. Click the **Activate this Workspace** button.

   4. Paste the license key in the **Enter license key** box in the **Activate workspace** modal.
   5. Click **Activate**. You will see a confirmation. 
   6. That's it. To check your plan at any time and find additional details, just go to the **Billing and plans** tab in **Workspace Settings**.
