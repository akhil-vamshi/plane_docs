## Cloud and self-hosted

To upgrade to a paid plan, follow the steps below:
<Warning>
Self-hosted editions will need one more step. [See here](#self-hosted-only).
</Warning>

1. On the Plane app, click the **âŒ„** icon next to your workspace name on the sidebar and select **Workspace Settings**.

    <Note>

## Self-hosted only
   <Warning>
   Starting v1.3.0, your license will need to be activated on a self-hosted instance of our Enterprise Edition. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.
   </Warning>
   
   Steps #1 through #5 from above work the exact same way on self-hosted, too. To activate the license on your workspace, follow the steps below:

   1. If your payment goes through, you will be redirected to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses), your one-stop interface to manage your licenses and buy new ones. Find the license by the plan you just subscribed to.

      <Note>
      Click the Get more licenses button as in the image above on the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses/plans) to buy more licenses.
      </Note>
   2. Copy the **License key** for the license you want to activate. 
   3. Go back to the **Billing and plans** screen, usually already open in your browser.
   4. Click the **Activate this Workspace** button.

   5. Paste the license key in the **Enter license key** box.
   5. Click **Activate**. You will see a confirmation. 
   6. That's it. To check your plan at any time and find additional details, just go to the **Billing and plans** tab in **Workspace Settings**.
