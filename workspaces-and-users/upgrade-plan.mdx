## Cloud and self-hosted

Follow the steps below to upgrade to a paid plan on any edition.

<Warning>
Self-hosted editions will need one more step. [See here](#self-hosted-only).
</Warning>

## Self-hosted only
   <Warning>
   Starting v1.3.0 of our Commercial Edition, your license will need to be activated on a workspace. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.
   </Warning>
   
   <Tip>
   Steps #1 through #5 from above work the exact same way on self-hosted, too. 
   </Tip>

   1. If your payment goes through, you will be redirected to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses), your one-stop interface to manage your licenses and buy new ones. 
      <Warning>
      You can always directly log into the Prime Portal, especially if you pre-ordered one of our plans, with the same email address you used to purchase one of our paid plans. You will get a code at the same address that will sign you in.
      </Warning>
   2. Find the license by the plan you just subscribed to. Copy the **License key** for the license you want to activate.

      <Note>
      Click the Get more licenses button as in the image above on the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses/plans) to buy more licenses.
      </Note>
   3. Go back to the **Billing and plans** screen, usually already open in your browser.
   4. Click the **Activate this Workspace** button.

   5. Click **Activate**. You will see a confirmation. 
   6. That's it. To check your plan at any time and find additional details, just go to the **Billing and plans** tab in **Workspace Settings**.
