At Plane, we aim to provide flexible billing options to cater to the diverse needs of our users. This page outlines our billing and refund policies for both cloud and self-hosted users.

Once you upgrade to a paid plan on either cloud or self-hosted instances, billing will apply based on the number of seats for users with **Admin** or **Member** roles in the workspace.

## Monthly billing

You will be charged for the number of active seats (Y) with **Admin** or **Member** roles in your workspace every month.

### Add new users

If you add new users (N) during the month, the N additional seats will be charged immediately and Y seats will be charged at the end of the current billing cycle. At the end of the current billing cycle, the total seats for the next billing cycle will be updated to Y + N.

### Remove users

If users are removed from the workspace, there will be no charges or immediate refunds for the removed seats. The unused seats will be prorated and adjusted in the next billing cycle.

### Change in user roles

If roles are changed during the billing cycle, new roles requiring **Admin** or **Member** seats will be charged immediately. 

### Downgrade plan

Seats will be available till the end of the current billing cycle. Post the billing cycle, you have the option to downgrade the plan.

### Cancel subscription

#### Cloud
- For workspaces with less than 12 members, the paid plan will remain active until the end of the billing cycle, after which you can cancel the subscription.
- If you have more than 12 members and choose to cancel, access to the product will be locked. Workspace admins will see a modal prompting to either manage members or upgrade to the paid plan.

#### Self-hosted

Seats will be available till the end of the current billing cycle. Post the billing cycle, you have the option to cancel the subscription.

## Yearly billing

You will be charged for the number of active seats (Y) with **Admin** or **Member** roles in your workspace every year. For workspaces with more than 100 users, Plane offers the option to sign a custom contract, including dedicated support and tailored billing arrangements. Please reach out to our sales team for more information.

### Add new users

If new users are added during the year, the seats will be charged on a prorated basis for the remaining billing cycle immediately.

### Remove users

No immediate charges or refunds for removed users. Instead, the seats will be charged on a prorated basis on your next billing cycle.

### Change in user roles

No immediate charges or refunds for changes to or from **Admin** or **Member** roles. Instead, the seats will be charged on a prorated basis on your next billing cycle.

### Downgrade plan

Seats will be available till the end of the current billing cycle. Post the billing cycle, you have the option to downgrade the plan.

### Cancel subscription

#### Cloud
- For workspaces with less than 12 members, the paid plan will remain active until the end of the billing cycle, after which you can cancel the subscription.
- If you have more than 12 members and choose to cancel, access to the product will be locked. Admins will see a modal prompting them to either manage members or upgrade to the paid plan.

#### Self-hosted
Seats will be available till the end of the current billing cycle. Post the billing cycle, you have the option to cancel the subscription.

## Refunds

Plane generally does not offer refunds. Charges are applied at the beginning of each billing cycle, and changes in team size or member roles are handled through prorated adjustments in the next cycle, as detailed above. For annual plans, no refunds are issued for unused seats; however, seats can continue to be used until the end of the current billing cycle.

If you experience any issues with billing or wish to discuss special circumstances, feel free to contact our support team for assistance.
