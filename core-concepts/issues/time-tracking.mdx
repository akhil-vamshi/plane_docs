## Overview

Log time per issue, record time by members and guests per issue, and download consolidated worklogs from one screen with Time Tracking in Plane.

Team members can easily log the time they spend working on specific issues directly within the issue details page. Each time entry can include details such as the amount of time spent and optional notes to provide context. This allows for more granular tracking and a clearer understanding of what was accomplished during the logged time. Plane offers comprehensive reports that aggregate time-tracking data across different projects. This helps project managers and stakeholders to analyze productivity, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to optimize workflows.
